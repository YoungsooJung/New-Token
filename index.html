<p>ATLANT Platform (hereinafter “ATLANT”) is building a next generation global real-estate platform based on blockchain technology. We believe blockchain has the potential to help accelerate the adoption of the Sharing Economy which has already begun to unleash industry disruption by opening up significant amounts of previously untapped private capacity and tokenization of property may completely change real estate transactions and ownership transfer as we know them. That is why we are using the token crowdsale mechanism to pre-sell our product and finance development as opposed to traditional venture capital. With a secure, tamper-proof system based on the blockchain, users can trade parcels of property on our platform and bypass intermediaries in rental deals, transacting P2P (peer-to-peer), all of which will enhance ease of use and security for guests and hosts alike, streamlining user experience and driving accelerated adoption.
